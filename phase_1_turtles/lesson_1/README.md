# Phase 1: Virtual Robotics with [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
## Lesson 1: Turtle Art
---
### Theoretical Coding Principals (`Python-related Syntax`)
* class-specific functions (e.g. `turtle.forward()`)
* iterating (e.g. `for` and `while`) 
---
### Practical Project-related Deliverables
* target 1: display the turtle world and turtle
* target 2: customise their shape and colours
* target 3: move the turtle to draw patterns
* target 4: use iteration to draw complex patterns
* target 5 (bonus): add stochasticity into patterns
